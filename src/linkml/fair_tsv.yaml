      # syntactic
      uses tab separators:
        range: uses tab separators result
        annotations:
          justification: tabs are most computable
      uses unix newline characters:
#        range: uses unix newline characters
      uses correct quotation:
      avoids extraneous whitespace:
      avoids problematic characters:
      avoids empty lines:
      uses correct encoding:
      has column header row:
      column headers are sane:
      all rows have same number of columns:
      metadata section clearly delineated:

      # filename
      filename uses computable character set:
      has appropriate suffix:
      indicates schema as suffix:

      # 
      

      # data dictionary
      includes metadata header:

      includes data dictionary:

      all column headers are in data dictionary:
        
      includes mappings to other schemas:

      # dates
      dates use iso8601:
      
      # identifiers
      identifiers are prefixed CURIEs:
      CURIEs are syntactically correct:
      prefixes are declared and consistent with registries:
      prefixes have URI expansions:

      # categorical values
      categorical values are enumerated in schema:
      categorical values are mapped to external resources:

      # units and measurements
      units are standardized:
      units are in separate column from quantity values:
      units are not implicit:

      # null values

      # structure
      data is tidy:
      validates using schema:
      has deterministic line ordering:
      
      

enums:
  uses tab separators result:
    permissible_values:
      unable to determine:
        annotations:
          score: 0
      tab separated:
        annotations:
          score: 2
      command separated:
        annotations:
          score: 2
      uses non standard:
        annotations:
          score: -1
